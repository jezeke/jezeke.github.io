## So He Thought He Could Start A Blog Huh?

Look man, I just want a job and a place to tell stories. This blog meets the second need and if you like what you see then I'm gonna need you to shoot me an email about that first one. Note, you may have already given me a job and I am now so busy working for you that I forgot to edit this blog page. If this is the case, get up from your computer and stick a thumbtack on my chair or give me a hi-five or something.

If you aren't in the job business but want to tell me something cool concerning or related to something I've posted about here, shoot me an email too; though you are also contractually obliged to give me dental insurance and a good retirement plan.

If you're a particularly dull person with no jobs to offer nor anything interesting and thought provoking to share, then by all means just send hate mail. I don't mind, it might be funny. Probably funnier than this blog.

If none of the above are the case then continue to read my blog until one of them is.

## So He Thought That Was A Good Reason Huh?

Hey dude, we'll see if it works. Besides, I thought I already told you to either email me or go read more of my blog posts? What are you still doing here?

## Who Is This Guy Anyway?
